bb-collection-view
==================

Why?
====

Backbonejs (http://backbonejs.org) provides a great basis for modern javascript development, but it provides no framework. These classes provide a simple and light-weight framework for creating an automatically updating view for collections of models as both regular collections as well as drop-down menus. These views also support sorting and filtering! They easily may provide the basis of an admin scaffolding.

Dependencies
============

* jQuery or Zepto
* Underscorejs or Lodash
* Backbonejs

Usage
=====

The demos included in this package provide a pretty thorough use-case. Simply create a new view and assign a collection to it. Append the CollectionView's el to the document, and it will work out of the box automatically!
